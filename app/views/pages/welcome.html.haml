%h1 Welcome

%p
  This application allows you to create, inspect and share calculations for a
  small Testing Ground, based on the underlying data from the
  %a{href:'http://et-model.com'} Energy Transition Model
  and real life testing grounds from
  %a{href:'http://alliander.com'} Alliander
  = "."

%p A Testing Ground consists of three components:

.row
  .col-md-4
    %h3 1. ETM Scenarios
    %p
      Every testing ground starts with a national scenario from the ETM, and
      a scaled down version of it.
  .col-md-4
    %h3 2. Network Topology
    %p
      A specific network structure needs to be defined. If none is defined,
      a default one is chosen.
  .col-md-4
    %h3 3. Technologies
    %p
      The technologies used in a Testing Ground are taken from the ETM as
      much as possible, and can be adapted to the specific situation by the
      user.

  %h2 Getting started&hellip;

  %p
    You may start by creating a testing ground completely from scratch,
    importing an existing, scaled down scenario from the Energy Transition
    Model, or view ready-made testing grounds for inspiration.
